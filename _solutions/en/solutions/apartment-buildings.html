<h1>Apartment Buildings</h1>

<p>Have you ever wondered why your energy expenses are so high? If you want to know the
consumption of your apartment exactly, choose Enectiva. We offer a simplified, easily operated
version of the Enectiva system designed for apartment buildings and individual flats. Among the
functions of this solution are <a href="/en/features/#Stats">monitoring</a>, <a href="/en/features/#Reports">reporting</a>, providing information on the consumption of
the individual energies and respective expenses. In one of its set ups, the system regularly sends you
reports on the energy consumption in your apartment in comparison with the buildingÂ´s average so
that you always know that you should improve your use of energy. You may also use the application
for invoicing, archiving of the invoices, deposit policies, real-time monitoring of the deposits, or for
sending automatic reports in case certain (adjustable) limits are exceeded. Simply put, Enectiva is a
complete tool of energy management of apartments.
