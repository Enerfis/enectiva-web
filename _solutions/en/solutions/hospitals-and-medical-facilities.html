<h1>Hospitals and medical facilities</h1>
  <p>
Hospitals, clinics, health centers and maternity hospitals are places where we heal our illnesses and
where most of us were born. Such buildings also have high energy demands, but they usually offer
many possibilities of <a href="/en/features/#Savings">saving energy</a> and achieving energy efficiency. If you use the Enectiva online
energy management system, you will be able to keep track of your achievements in terms of energy.
The system also helps hospital managers to monitor energy consumption not only in the whole
compound, but also in its individual parts and sections. Quick detection of wasting, finding places
suitable for <a href="/en/features/#Exchanges">investments</a>, simplification of administration of energy data â€“ these are only some of the
benefits of Enectiva. As it is the case also with public buildings and cities, hospitals may be <a href="/en/features/#Stats">compared</a>
in terms of energy with similar buildings via Enectiva.
