    <h2 id="Stats" class="feature__title">Detailed Consumption and Costs Statistics</h2>

    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>With Enectiva, all your data concerning consumption will be neatly arranged and organized in one place. In this way, you can monitor the overall energy consumption in the building (gas, cold water, hot water, heat, cold, electric power – separate for the ventilation system, lighting, appliances, or cold generation operation).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature__desc">
        <p>You can display for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Proportional Graphs</strong> – they show the influence of energy on the final costs, the energy usage of various parts of the building compared to the overall consumption of the building, or the influence of the occupants, facilities and unmeasured consumption.
                <br /></li>
            <li><strong>Comparative Graphs</strong> – they serve to compare the usage of two or more parts on the same level (buildings, parts of buildings, occupants, facilities,…). The benchmarking of the comparable parts of the portfolio enables you to discover buildings or occupants that differ conspicuously from the others and thus detect needless waste of energy.
                <br />{{ "detailed statistics 2" | gallery_link: "statistics_2.en", 1 }}</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Consumption</strong> – you can see the development of the usage of individual energy resources during the year. Moreover, you can combine the graph with the development of temperature and thus control if the development of consumption corresponds to the climatic conditions in a given location. Thanks to the integrated price lists of all utilities, you can switch these graphs also to a final costs diagram.
                <br />{{ "detailed statistics 3" | gallery_link: "meteo.en", 1 }}</li>
            <li><strong>Development Graphs</strong> – they show the cumulative sum of the consumption or costs. In this way, you can very easily display the growth rate of your consumption during the monitored period.

<div class="feature">
    {{ "e-mail reports" | gallery_link: "reports.en", 2, 'feature__image' }}
    <h2 id="Reports" class="feature__title">Automatic Reports</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>You can easily set an unlimited number of automatic reports in Enectiva. Two basic types of reports are available:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature__desc">
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Regular Time Report</strong><br />
                After setting the time interval, this type of report will automatically send the data chosen by you directly to your e-mail. The extent and make-up of the data in the report depends only on you. You can add consumption and costs data to the report in the form of both charts and graphs. Each user can customize his report make-up and receive only data that are of interest or importance to him. Thus, you do not have to go through large amount of data and look for those relevant to you.<br /><br /></li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Notice</strong><br />
                The job of an emergency notice is to inform you that a certain critical point has been reached. As with the regular reports, you decide what Enectiva should monitor. It can control, for example, the exceeding of a certain consumption or costs figure, the necessity to inspect some part of the equipment or a measuring device, the change of outside temperature, or (thanks to Enectiva’s connection to energy exchanges) even the development of energy prices on the PEX and EEX exchanges.</li>
        </ol>

<div class="feature">
    {{ "saving analysis" | gallery_link: "saving.en", 3, 'feature__image' }}
    <h2 id="Savings" class="feature__title">Saving Analysis</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>If you realize any energy project on your building or if you introduce cost-saving measures, the second and no less important phase of such a project follows – the monitoring of appreciation, and optimization. Not even the best design of a project or measure can cover all factors influencing the development of the project’s appreciation. Thus, the monitoring and assessment of the progress, and the following optimization are indispensable for all such projects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature__desc">
        <p>Enectiva helps you with this task. It makes all calculations for you and, on one single page, you can easily see the consumption development and its comparison with the average consumption during the last three years. You can further see the monthly savings made by the measure and the development of and prediction for the financial side of the project, using the cash flow method based on economic parameters. As a result, you can easily find out whether the project is still in the stage of repaying the investment or of profitability, and also the current estimated NPV value at the end of the project’s lifespan.</p>

<div class="feature">
    {{ 'Meteodata' | gallery_link: "meteo.en", 4, 'feature__image' }}
    <h2 id="Meteo" class="feature__title">Meteodata</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>Enectiva is connected to the network of weather stations all around the Czech Republic. When entering the input data of a building, you chose the weather station nearest to it. Enectiva will then receive its climatic conditions information, which you can display in a single graph with the consumption of individual energy resources. Thus, you can easily control whether the energy used on heating and cooling corresponds to the outside climatic conditions. Such comparison easily detects mistakes in the regulation setting of the mentioned systems.</p>

    </div>

<div class="feature">

    <h2 id="Maps" class="feature__title">Google Maps Support</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>Do you need to quickly look up information on several different buildings in your portfolio? Forget the annoying searching through many archived files. In Enectiva, you can switch from one building to another with only three clicks, thanks to its connection to Google Maps.</p>

    </div>

<div class="feature">
    <h2 id="Users" class="feature__title">Unlimited Number of Users under a Licence</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>Enectiva’s licence system is unique on the Czech market mainly due to its applicability to a number of buildings and meters that are monitored. The number of users or access PCs is not important. You determine the number of user accounts yourself directly in the Enectiva interface according to your immediate needs, without any of the changes influencing your licence invoice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature__desc">
        <p>Another advantage of this kind of licence is that there is no need to contact the sales team in order to increase or decrease the number of user accounts, and to deal with the related paperwork. The result is a faster administration of user accounts that responds immediately to your current needs and the company’s structure.</p>

    {{ "Easy input of meter reading data" | gallery_link: "bulk_readings.en", 6, 'feature__image' }}
    <h2 id="Readings" class="feature__title">Easy Input of Meter Reading Data</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>Meter reading data can be put into Enectiva either manually or they can be sent in via a remote device. For manual input you can use a simple form right within Enectiva or (for example to input older meter reading data) a prepared form in the .xls format (MS Excel). In this way, for example, you can easily copy data from an existing chart to the model chart we prepared and, after you load the file, Enectiva will process the data.</p>

    </div>
</div>

<div class="feature">
    <h2 id="Import" class="feature__title">Automatic Remote Meter Reading Support</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>Data can be put into Enectiva also by means of remote meter reading. This allows you to save the time spent by your technician every month reading the meters manually.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature__desc">
        <p>Enectiva is prepared for a wide range of hardware products that enable remote meter reading. Whether the data are collected on a wire or wireless basis is not important. Similarly, the producer and the type of the remote meter, or the data bus on the basis of which it works, do not matter. The basis for the correct functioning of Enectiva are the right data at the right time. Therefore, the system itself can take the data from your internal data storage or they can be sent through the hardware of your choice directly to your server, where they will be recorded and processed.</p>

    {{ "User rights hierarchy" | gallery_link: "status.en", 7, 'feature__image' }}
    <h2 id="Auth" class="feature__title">User Rights Hierarchy</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>Every company has a hierarchy of workers according to their authorities. Enectiva reflects this fact by the possibility of assigning each user authorities within the system. Thus, by setting the type of account, you can easily determine for each user what he can view and edit in the system.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature__desc">
        <p>At present, we respect the following <strong>types of users</strong>:<br />
            Administrator, Technician, Occupant, Facility manager, Property manager, Asset manager, Portfolio manager, Owner. All these users are distinguished by different rights and options within the system.</p>
    </div>

    {{ "Integrated utilities price lists" | gallery_link: "price_list.en", 8, 'feature__image' }}
    <h2 id="Prices" class="feature__title">Integrated Utilities Price Lists</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>Enectiva contains the price lists of all utility distributors active in the Czech Republic. You choose your distributor in the system, put in the unit price for the utility arranged with the supplier, and Enectiva will automatically count the overall costs according to the formulas given by ERO (Energy Regulatory Office).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature__desc">
        <p>Of course, an update is made by our development team every time a new price decision is issued by ERO.</p>

<div class="feature">
    <h2 id="UI" class="feature__title">Intuitive & Easy to Use Interface</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
      <p>Non-technical users can understand energy management. During the development of the user interface, our team focused on maximum ease and intuitiveness of Enectiva. All functions and controls are designed in such a way that, after a short initial training, each user gets quickly familiar with Enectiva. An inspiration during the development of the user interface and its functions were, for example, products of the Google corporation.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="feature">

    <h2 id="Meters" class="feature__title">Easy Management of Meters</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>In Enectiva, meters are included in the floor plans of a building. Therefore, you can easily display the individual floors of a building and edit the meters directly from the plans. This saves you the toilsome searching through documents and charts in order for you or your technician to locate the various meters.</p>
    </div>

<div class="feature">
    {{ 'Drag&Drop function' | gallery_link: 'drag_drop.en', 10, 'feature__image' }}
    <h2 id="Drag" class="feature__title">Drag&amp;Drop Function</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>Enectiva tries to solve any task in the most simple and elegant way possible. The Drag&amp;Drop function enables you to move all data to a newly selected higher category by simply grabbing and dragging an occupant, a building, or a complex.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature__desc">
        <p>For example, if you manage a portfolio of more investors and one buys a real estate from the other, you transfer all data about this real estate into the new owner’s portfolio with a single move.</p>

    {{ 'Facility management 1' | gallery_link: 'facility_management.en', 11, 'feature__image' }}
    <h2 id="Facility" class="feature__title">Facility Management</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>Enectiva contains the basic features of facility management such as the following parameters: “total floor area”, “gross floor area”, or “gross leasable area”. These areas can be distinguished in Enectiva according to their use (for example as offices, storerooms, facilities, retail, etc.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature__desc">
        <p>Similarly, you can input the number of occupants of the object, parking spots, kitchenettes, WCs, urinals and the like. All these parameters are divided into the overall number and the currently occupied or used ones.</p>
        <p>As a result, Enectiva can recalculate the consumption and costs to the specific consumption or specific costs according to the selected criterion. The data are archived and you can view the time development of these parameters at any time in the future.</p>

    <h2 id="Events" class="feature__title">Events</h2>
    <div class="feature__perex">
        <p>You can enter any change that occurs in your building or portfolio into Enectiva (for example, the heat/cold source replacement, a change of the energy supplier, a change of the energy price, windows replacement, thermal insulation of the object, etc.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="feature__desc">
        <p>You can then display these changes in the monthly consumption graphs. In a simple and fast way, you can see the change in the consumption and costs development due to these events.</p>
