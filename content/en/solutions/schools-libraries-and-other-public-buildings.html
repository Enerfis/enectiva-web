<h1>Schools, libraries and other public buildings</h1>

<p>Enectiva is an ideal solution for energy management of school buildings, government offices, fire
stations or medical facilities. Thanks to Enectiva, those who administer such buildings always know
the amount of consumed energy and the corresponding expenses. It only takes several clicks to
detect wasting or compare energy consumption with regards to the area used, the number of pupils
or the number of patients. Enectiva automatically analyzes <a href="/en/features/#Savings">cost-saving measures</a>, evaluates them
and assesses their revenue. <a href="/en/features/#Redings">Meter readings</a> are easily entered and archived in the system. Employees
may be given various <a href="/en/features/#Auth">kinds of access</a> to the system as well as different rights. The result is a
complete, more efficient administration of a public building that leads to up to 20% of savings in its
operation.</p>
