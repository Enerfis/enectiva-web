<h1>Business Centers</h1>

<p>Enectiva is an ideal solution for energy management of business centers, retail parks and business
compounds. Tenants may be <a href="/en/features/#Auth">granted access</a> to the system so that they can keep track of their
consumption and energy expenses. Enectiva makes much easier the otherwise difficult and tedious
task of administering consumption data, charging the individual tenants  and justifying the invoices.
The system records the consumption of energy in time, detects wasting and motivates the tenants
and building owners to save energy. Enectiva also creates lists that rank the individual tenants
according to their consumption and therefore motivates them to use energy more efficiently.
