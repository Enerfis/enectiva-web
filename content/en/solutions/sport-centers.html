<h1>Sport centers</h1>

<p>Playgrounds, swimming pools, water parks – all these places have high demands in terms of energy
consumption and it is difficult to keep them <a href="/en/features/#Facility">profitable</a>. This is why it is crucial to operate all the
technology efficiently – and Enectiva will help you. You will get precise information about the
performance and consumption of technological devices such as heating, cooling, lighting or
humidifying systems. Such technology not only influences the interior microclimate of the building,
but depending on the outside climate it also has a significant impact on the total operating expenses.
Most businesses and operations underestimate how important it is to have the technological
equipment turn off when it is not actually needed. It is often the case that heating is working even
though the <a href="/en/features/#Meteo">outside temperature</a> allows it not to, or the AC unit is turned on even though there is
nobody in the building, etc. If such wasting is eliminated, the savings in operating expenditure may
go up to 20%.</p>
