<h1>Cities, villages, counties</h1>

<p>Energy policies of cities, villages or counties or other districts are a crucial part of any local
administration. Experienced professionals and experts that would continuously aim to reduce energy
consumption of administered buildings and facilities are often lacking on the local level. This is why
there are so many possibilities to make the use of energy much more efficient in state-administered
buildings, as well as to simplify corresponding administration and improve the communication
between the individual administrators and local offices. As it provides you with detailed information
on consumption, expenses and potential savings, Enectiva helps you develop a clear energy policy.
The system allows for <a href="/en/features/#Auth">special accounts</a> for cities and villages â€“ such accounts allow the individual
cities to see the efficiency of their energy use in the context of the whole Czech Republic. Using
Enectiva, you will be able to <a href="/en/features/#Stats">compare</a> your school, library or city hall with similar buildings in the
country in terms of energy use. Enectiva also serves as a simple tool of invoicing energies to tenants
or of providing reports about energy data to the management of buildings or districts.
