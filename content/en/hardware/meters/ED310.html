	    <h2> ED310 – 3 phase electricity meter on DIN rail </h2>
            <p>The ED310 is a three-phase four-energy energy meter class A or B active energy meter designed for direct (ED310) and indirect (ED310.I) connections. It converts the analogue signal from the current and voltage sensor to digital, performs calculations, controls the display, senses tariff inputs, communicates over the opto interface, generates IR and S pulses, and stores the selected values and data, and adapts the meter's properties to the requirements and needs of the customer. The measuring system allows measurement even in the presence of DC and harmonic components in the measured circuit throughout the measuring range of the meter. The calibration of the measuring system is done programmatically.</p>
