	    <h2> Industrial Water meter Flostar 25-50-300-G2 1/2'' </h2>
	    <p>Water meter Flostar 25-50-300-G2 1/2 '' is a single-flow industrial water meter for SV, cl. Precision C with high precision in a wide flow range. An advantage is the possibility of a large overload for two hours (fire sampling), 1.5x Qmax. It has a hydrostatically and hydrodynamically balanced turbine measuring mechanism, minimal friction resistance, high precision, low pressure loss and metrological stability. Rolling turbine placement means extended lifetime and higher sensitivity in the area of very small flows.</p>
