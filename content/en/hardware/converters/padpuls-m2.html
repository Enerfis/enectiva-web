		To monitor your water or electricity consumption using Enectiva, we need to centrally read the data by M-Bus. That can be achieved by the 2-channel pulse adaptor PadPuls M2 that allows the use of up to 2 meters with pulse output as M-Bus slaves. The transmission rate is from 300 to 2400 bps and there is a safe detection of up to 15 pulses per second at each input.

	    <ul>
		<li>Two separated pulse inputs</li>
		<li>Safe detection of up to 15 pulses per second at each input</li>
		<li>Pulse debouncing</li>
		<li>Pulse value free adjustable</li>
		<li>Unit free selectable (e.g. Wh, kWh, MWh, kJ, m3, l etc.)</li>
		<li>Counter length: 8 decimal digits</li>
		<li>M-Bus protocol according to EN13757-2 and -3</li>
		<li>Fully parameterized by M-Bus, including overwrite protection</li>
		<li>Transmission rate: 300 and 2400 baud with auto baud detection</li>
		<li>Supplied by M-Bus, or integrated battery at an M-Bus failure, needs no power supply unit.</li>
		<li>Dimension: W x H x D: 80 x 80 x 52 mm</li>
		<li>Two battery options available</li>
		<li>Temperature range: 0°C to 55°C </li>
