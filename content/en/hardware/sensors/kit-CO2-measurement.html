    <h2> Kit for CO2 concentration measurements</h2>
    <p>
      As a reaction to the demand for measuring indoor microclimate parameters, we have prepared a completely pre-set CO2 concentration measurement kit. It consists of a central unit (M2M Gateway) with a 169 MHz interface, which wirelessly connects individual sensors and also wireless CO2 sensors. Installation of the whole set is simplified to the absolute minimum. It consists of connecting the central unit to a socket, connecting the packed antenna and connecting the battery (also part of the kit) inside the CO2 sensor. When the central unit is connected, it automatically logs on to the Enectiva server. A CO2 sensor automatically sends information every 15 minutes about the CO2 status, the central unit receives this information and sends it to the Enectiva server. Our M2M Gateway can received up to 999 sensors. Through web access at www.enectiva.cz, anyone can see the results of all monitored sites.
