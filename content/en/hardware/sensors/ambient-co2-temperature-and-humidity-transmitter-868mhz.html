    <h2> Ambient CO2, temperature and humidity transmitter (868 MHz)</h2>
    <p>
        In Enectiva we are aware of an importance of CO2 presence in the air since workers and students spend about half of their waking hours at work or school. Therefore, maintaining adequate indoor air quality in schools and the workplace is becoming a top priority for facility managers and building operating engineers. Enectiva is capable of deploying a universal sensor that measures temperature, humidity and CO2 that gives you a perfect awareness about your indoor environment. Then we can help you to locate the shortcomings and eliminate them. It operates on a frequency of 868 MHz.
