        <p>Amber wireless is a very simple yet dependable transmitter operating in the Mbus Wireless standard, which can be connected to any meter with a pulse output (S0 output). This is typically an electric, gas or water meter. The transmitter converts the pulse output to a wireless radio transmission, frequency 868MHz, which is then further processed in the concentrator.  </p>
