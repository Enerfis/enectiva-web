**Are you curious enough?**

Every human being is born with innate curiosity. Right from the moment of our birth, we start exploring and learning. Unfortunately, as we get older, most of us gradually lose our curiosity. Possibly because we use the proverb “Curiosity killed the cat”.

However, curiosity is a key factor in achieving energy efficiency. Let us take an example: an administrative building with tenants and an administrator, whose task from his position of the representative of the owner is to divide energy expenses between the individual tenants so that there is no remainder. This task is fairly easy if the consumption is monitored only through several meters and if it is divided up proportionally, based on the leased area, usually in the form of deposits paid in advance and then reimbursed later. Such a system does not allow any improvement towards energy efficiency as it does not motivate anybody to change the status quo. The key is to motivate the tenants themselves. If they are curious about their consumption and about how they use energy, they can change the perspective of the owner of the building as well. Also, if they are curious about the energy expenses of other buildings of the same type, they can learn more about efficiency of their own energy use. 

Have you ever asked your neighbor how much electric energy or water he or she uses in a month?

Curiosity is crucial in energy management and in the work of those who study graphs, tables, values and data related to efficiency, performance and consumption. A successful energy manager is one that is seeks to unravel inconsistencies and to understand the analyzed data.

Have you ever thought about by how many per cent you can reduce your consumption but still keep maximum efficiency of operation?

Be curious!
